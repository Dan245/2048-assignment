# 2048 Assignment

## Task
**Complete a half-finished minimalist 2048 game clone & add features.**

## Features Added
1. VISUAL UPDATE
    - each tile has it's own unique sprite
    - fancy background
    - fancy-ish game over screen
    - all images were scraped from original web game
2. TILE SLIDING
   - tiles slide instead of blinking in and out of existence
   - gameboard & merge functions had to be reworked for smooth animation and correct timing
3. GAME OVER SCREEN
    - can play again after losing
    - final score shown

Amazing work on implementing this game. You made regular commits and demonstrated a strong understanding of OOP concepts.

The animation is very slick! I like how you handle adding a new block only after the user has pressed the correct key (I don't know how to explain this feature in words but it is cool)

You commenting could definitley use improvement around your new implementations.
